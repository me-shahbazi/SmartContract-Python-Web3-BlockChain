# SmartContract-Python-Web3-BlockChain
This repository provides a practical demonstration of how to deploy and interact with a simple smart contract on the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain network. It includes two core components: a Solidity smart contract (Register.sol) for storing and retrieving information and a Python script utilizing Web3 to interact with the deployed contract.
