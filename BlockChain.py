# Infura is a Web3 development platform that provides scalable API access to blockchain networks like 
# Ethereum and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). It simplifies the process of connecting decentralized applications (dApps) 
# to these networks by handling the heavy lifting of node management, data synchronization, and network connectivity.

# Infura offers easy-to-use APIs for interacting with blockchain networks, eliminating the need for developers to run their own node.
